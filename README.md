# CE888Assignment2
## Respository
All notebooks are placed in [codes](https://github.com/Liv008/CE888Assignment2/tree/main/codes), named ```all.ipynb```, ```control.ipynb``` and ```test.ipynb```. Names indicate on which dataset the model was trained and evaluated.

The dataset is included in the respository in the [EyeT](https://github.com/Liv008/CE888Assignment2/tree/main/EyeT) folder, separated into test, control and both groups.

Questionarie answers are also included in the respository under [questionaries](https://github.com/Liv008/CE888Assignment2/tree/main/questionaries) folder.

## Run the code
To run the codes, the respository need to be downloaded first. <br>
Under the section __Loading input data and preprocessing__ in each Notebook, the ```path``` variable need to be changed so it reflects the relative path to the dataset folder.
```
path = 'Relative_Path_to_EyeT/'
```
